## 🧩 Mod Philosophy

Boostify does **not rely on a fixed list of mods**. Instead, it includes only the most effective performance-boosting and QoL mods **based on their stability and efficiency for specific Minecraft versions**.

However, a few essential mods are **almost always included**, such as:

- [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin)
- [BetterF3](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3)
- [Dynamic FPS](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps)
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) / [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium) (Fabric/Forge)
- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (Fabric)
- [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core)
- [LazyDFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu) *(version-dependent)*
- [ModernFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernfix) *(for newer versions)*

> ⚠️ Mod selection adapts based on the Minecraft version to ensure maximum performance and compatibility.
